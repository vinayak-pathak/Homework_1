## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
2+2
```
```{r}
df <- read.csv2(file ="Chr20ex.csv", sep = "\t", header = FALSE)
```

```{r}
summary(df)

```
```{r}
head(df)
```

```{r}
count(df)
```

So there are 500 rows in the dataframe, i.e. 500 records
```{r}
df_pass <-df %>% filter(V7 == "PASS")
```

```{r}
head(df_pass)
```

```{r}
count(df_pass)[1, ]
```
Therefore total 500 records with
```{r}
df_c_t <- df %>% 
  filter(V4 == "C", V5 =='T')
```

```{r}
count(df_c_t)[1, ]
```
There for total 116 records withh C->T SNPs in the Data
```{r}
head(df_c_t)
```

```{r}
head(df_c_t)
```
