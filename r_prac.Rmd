## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

plot(pressure)

```{r}
starwars
```
```{r}
starwars %>% filter(skin_color == "light", eye_color == "brown")
```

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, ends_with("color"))
```
